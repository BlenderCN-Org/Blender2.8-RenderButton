It gets added at the bottom of the Render Properties windows, just move it up and save over the startup file to always have it up at the beginning.

**This is a quick hackjob, should not cause any issue but use on your own risk.**
Removing/Adding the addon does not seem to cause any issues.

Not sure about licenses and stuff but feel free to edit/improve/share it as you like.
Its not like this is some mega complex script or anything.
